The Dual Arrhenius Michaelis Menten model

was built for heterotrophic respiration. 

It has been applied to soil respiration

and ecosystem respiration (REF). 

This package contains scripts to visualize the model and fit it to data. 

For example, it can be used to:
gap-fill and partition flux tower (eddy-covariance) or soil respiration datasets
estimate parameters, e.g. to investigate how they vary in space and time, or by soil and biome
gap-fill soil respiration datasets
estimate parameters of soil incubation

It can also be used to produce publication ready figures.
