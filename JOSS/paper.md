# Summary

Current climate change is mostly the result of increasing atmospheric greenhouse
gases concentration, particularly carbon dioxide (CO~2~). The land has
been absorbing about a third of anthropogenic CO~2~ emissions, but this may change.
Earth System Models attempts to predict future climate, accounting for feedbacks, 
including how the land will respond. The Dual Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten
(DAMM) kinetics model is a semi-mechanistic model of heterotrophic respiration 
[@Davidson:2012], it estimates respiration as a response to soil temperature and
soil moisture. This model can be applied at various scales by empiricists and modelers
to better understand respiration. 

# Statement of need

`DAMMmodel` is a Julia package providing functions to use, parameterize, and visualize
the DAMM model. The Julia programming language is particularly adequate, as empiricists
require simple synthax, and modelers require speed. `DAMMmodel` may be directly used
from Earth System Models as a module, and by empiricists to parameterize the model to
their data and visualize the results. It may also be used for teaching.
